## Abstract
This project aims to exam the text classification problem with novel approaches Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Attention Networks using Deep Learning algorithms and Natural Language Processing Techniques.

## Build
It is applicable for only Linux distros. You can update the commands and use the equivalent ones in other distros (Mac, Windows, etc.) Executing `buid.sh` will create a new _virtual environment_ in the project folder and install dependencies into that. Run the following command to build: 

```bash
bash build.sh 
```

Be sure that your computer is connected to internet. It can take a while to download and install the dependencies.
